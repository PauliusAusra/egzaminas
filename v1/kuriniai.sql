(39, 'The atrocious fairytale', 'I must warn you… this book is ATROCIOUS!\r\nThe cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak.\r\nEven some of the order are in the wrong words.\r\nIt is the worst of the worst, so don’t say I didn’t warn you…\r\n\r\nOur story begins with an atrocious King, \r\nNone of his laws ever made any sense.\r\n“Tuesday?” he laughed, “There is no such day, and I’ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.”\r\nFrom that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday.\r\n\r\nHis daughter was an atrocious Princess.\r\nShe was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day.\r\nShe never brushed her hair. \r\nShe smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious.\r\nShe even set traps throughout this story.  [Illustrations throughout the story will indicate the Princess’ traps]\r\n\r\nOne day the Princess went missing. \r\nIn her place there was a note that read:\r\n“I’ve  taken the Princess.\r\nYou me catch never will.”\r\nAfter reading the note twice to understand it, the King commanded the greatest hero in the land to find his daughter. \r\n\r\nThe greatest hero in the land happened to be an atrocious hero.\r\nHe was often too frightened to leave his home, and he was also scared by butterflies.\r\nHowever, he had once defeated two caterpillars and a moth in a single battle, and this made him the greatest of all the heroes in the land.\r\n\r\nThe hero rode to the castle of the meanest villain in the kingdom, but the villain, too was atrocious.\r\nHe brought flowers to old ladies whenever he could. \r\nAnd out of the kindness of his heart, he once built a house for someone who needed it. [The hero]\r\n\r\nThe hero stormed the gate and charged into the dungeon of the villain’s castle.\r\n“Surrender the Princess!” he yelled while shaking in his armor.\r\n“I don’t have a Princess,” said the villain, “I use this dungeon to bake cookies, but watch your step because there’s a leak down here.” [An example of a Princess trap with words floating in water.]\r\nThe hero was more confused than usual.\r\n“If you didn’t take the Princess, then who did?” asked the hero. “We should go ask the dragon what he thinks.”\r\n\r\nMind you, this was an atrocious dragon. \r\nHe was known for being tidy and wise, not fierce and ferocious like dragons are supposed to be. \r\nHe brushed his teeth every night, and when he breathed, there was no fire, just minty freshness.\r\n\r\nThe dragon was very upset when they found him. \r\n“Someone’s stolen my gold, and they left this note in its place!” he cried.\r\nIt read:\r\n“Your gold is with the Princess!\r\nMine now is it!”\r\n\r\n“This is odd,” said the hero.\r\n“Very odd,” said the villain.\r\n“Frmph,” said the dragon who always flossed his teeth when he was upset.\r\n“Perhaps the Queen knows something.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen was running around the castle when they arrived.\r\nShe, actually, was not so atrocious (for it was she who hired the royal scribe who wrote this very book).\r\n“My treasures are missing” she cried. “My books and jewels, and my fine silk.”\r\n“Someone has taken them and left this atrocious note.”\r\nIt read:\r\n“Your treasure is mine!\r\nDo not trying to bother find it.”\r\n\r\n“Whoever has stolen your treasure has the Princess,” said the hero.\r\n“Here are some flowers,” said the villain.\r\n“Look!” said the dragon, “there are footprints of dirt on the floor.”\r\n\r\nThey followed the footprints all the way up to the tallest tower in the tallest part of the castle.\r\nWhen they looked inside they found all the gold, books, jewels, and silk, covered in dirt.\r\nAnd sitting on a throne on top of the pile, was the Princess.\r\n\r\n“Why did you steal these things and make us look for you?” asked the Queen.\r\n“I didn’t want to go to my writing lessons!” said the Princess, “Who needs writing?”\r\n“You do,” said the Queen.  The villain, knight, and dragon all nodded in agreement.\r\nThe Queen made the Princess return what she had stolen and apologize.\r\n\r\nFrom that day on, the King made the Princess go to her lessons six days a week.\r\nShe was an atrocious student when they began, but she got better each day.\r\nIt took the dragon hours to brush all the dirt off his coins.\r\nThe villain developed a taste for soggy cookies, and he baked them all the time.\r\nThe hero decided it was finally time to battle a butterfly… and he lost.\r\nAs for the Queen, she insisted that the entire atrocious tale be written inside of one of her muddy books.\r\n\r\nI warned you this book was atrocious, and now it is over!\r\nPerhaps, one day you could write a better one…', 27, 9),
(40, 'Forty years of the internet: how the world changed for ever', 'Towards the end of the summer of 1969 – a few weeks after the moon landings, a few days after Woodstock, and a month before the first broadcast of Monty Python\'s Flying Circus – a large grey metal box was delivered to the office of Leonard Kleinrock, a professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. It was the same size and shape as a household refrigerator, and outwardly, at least, it had about as much charm. But Kleinrock was thrilled: a photograph from the time shows him standing beside it, in requisite late-60s brown tie and brown trousers, beaming like a proud father.\r\n\r\nHad he tried to explain his excitement to anyone but his closest colleagues, they probably wouldn\'t have understood. The few outsiders who knew of the box\'s existence couldn\'t even get its name right: it was an IMP, or \"interface message processor\", but the year before, when a Boston company had won the contract to build it, its local senator, Ted Kennedy, sent a telegram praising its ecumenical spirit in creating the first \"interfaith message processor\". Needless to say, though, the box that arrived outside Kleinrock\'s office wasn\'t a machine capable of fostering understanding among the great religions of the world. It was much more important than that.\r\n\r\nIt\'s impossible to say for certain when the internet began, mainly because nobody can agree on what, precisely, the internet is. (This is only partly a philosophical question: it is also a matter of egos, since several of the people who made key contributions are anxious to claim the credit.) But 29 October 1969 – 40 years ago next week – has a strong claim for being, as Kleinrock puts it today, \"the day the infant internet uttered its first words\". At 10.30pm, as Kleinrock\'s fellow professors and students crowded around, a computer was connected to the IMP, which made contact with a second IMP, attached to a second computer, several hundred miles away at the Stanford Research Institute, and an undergraduate named Charley Kline tapped out a message. Samuel Morse, sending the first telegraph message 125 years previously, chose the portentous phrase: \"What hath God wrought?\" But Kline\'s task was to log in remotely from LA to the Stanford machine, and there was no opportunity for portentousness: his instructions were to type the command LOGIN.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nTo say that the rest is history is the emptiest of cliches – but trying to express the magnitude of what began that day, and what has happened in the decades since, is an undertaking that quickly exposes the limits of language. It\'s interesting to compare how much has changed in computing and the internet since 1969 with, say, how much has changed in world politics. Consider even the briefest summary of how much has happened on the global stage since 1969: the Vietnam war ended; the cold war escalated then declined; the Berlin Wall fell; communism collapsed; Islamic fundamentalism surged. And yet nothing has quite the power to make people in their 30s, 40s or 50s feel very old indeed as reflecting upon the growth of the internet and the world wide web. Twelve years after Charley Kline\'s first message on the Arpanet, as it was then known, there were still only 213 computers on the network; but 14 years after that, 16 million people were online, and email was beginning to change the world; the first really usable web browser wasn\'t launched until 1993, but by 1995 we had Amazon, by 1998 Google, and by 2001, Wikipedia, at which point there were 513 million people online. Today the figure is more like 1.7 billion.\r\n\r\nUnless you are 15 years old or younger, you have lived through the dotcom bubble and bust, the birth of Friends Reunited and Craigslist and eBay and Facebook and Twitter, blogging, the browser wars, Google Earth, filesharing controversies, the transformation of the record industry, political campaigning, activism and campaigning, the media, publishing, consumer banking, the pornography industry, travel agencies, dating and retail; and unless you\'re a specialist, you\'ve probably only been following the most attention-grabbing developments. Here\'s one of countless statistics that are liable to induce feelings akin to vertigo: on New Year\'s Day 1994 – only yesterday, in other words – there were an estimated 623 websites. In total. On the whole internet. \"This isn\'t a matter of ego or crowing,\" says Steve Crocker, who was present that day at UCLA in 1969, \"but there has not been, in the entire history of mankind, anything that has changed so dramatically as computer communications, in terms of the rate of change.\"\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nLooking back now, Kleinrock and Crocker are both struck by how, as young computer scientists, they were simultaneously aware that they were involved in something momentous and, at the same time, merely addressing a fairly mundane technical problem. On the one hand, they were there because of the Russian Sputnik satellite launch, in 1957, which panicked the American defence establishment, prompting Eisenhower to channel millions of dollars into scientific research, and establishing Arpa, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, to try to win the arms technology race. The idea was \"that we would not get surprised again,\" said Robert Taylor, the Arpa scientist who secured the money for the Arpanet, persuading the agency\'s head to give him a million dollars that had been earmarked for ballistic missile research. With another pioneer of the early internet, JCR Licklider, Taylor co-wrote the paper, \"The Computer As A Communication Device\", which hinted at what was to come. \"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face,\" they declared. \"That is rather a startling thing to say, but it is our conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the breakthrough accomplished that night in 1969 was a decidedly down-to-earth one. The Arpanet was not, in itself, intended as some kind of secret weapon to put the Soviets in their place: it was simply a way to enable researchers to access computers remotely, because computers were still vast and expensive, and the scientists needed a way to share resources. (The notion that the network was designed so that it would survive a nuclear attack is an urban myth, though some of those involved sometimes used that argument to obtain funding.) The technical problem solved by the IMPs wasn\'t very exciting, either. It was already possible to link computers by telephone lines, but it was glacially slow, and every computer in the network had to be connected, by a dedicated line, to every other computer, which meant you couldn\'t connect more than a handful of machines without everything becoming monstrously complex and costly. The solution, called \"packet switching\" – which owed its existence to the work of a British physicist, Donald Davies – involved breaking data down into blocks that could be routed around any part of the network that happened to be free, before getting reassembled at the other end.\r\n\r\n\"I thought this was important, but I didn\'t really think it was as challenging as what I thought of as the \'real research\',\" says Crocker, a genial Californian, now 65, who went on to play a key role in the expansion of the internet. \"I was particularly fascinated, in those days, by artificial intelligence, and by trying to understand how people think. I thought that was a much more substantial and respectable research topic than merely connecting up a few machines. That was certainly useful, but it wasn\'t art.\"\r\n\r\nStill, Kleinrock recalls a tangible sense of excitement that night as Kline sat down at the SDS Sigma 7 computer, connected to the IMP, and at the same time made telephone contact with his opposite number at Stanford. As his colleagues watched, he typed the letter L, to begin the word LOGIN.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\n\"Have you got the L?\" he asked, down the phone line. \"Got the L,\" the voice at Stanford responded.\r\n\r\nKline typed an O. \"Have you got the O?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got the O,\" Stanford replied.\r\n\r\nKline typed a G, at which point the system crashed, and the connection was lost. The G didn\'t make it through, which meant that, quite by accident, the first message ever transmitted across the nascent internet turned out, after all, to be fittingly biblical:\r\n\r\n\"LO.\"\r\n\r\nFrenzied visions of a global conscious brain\r\n\r\nOne of the most intriguing things about the growth of the internet is this: to a select group of technological thinkers, the surprise wasn\'t how quickly it spread across the world, remaking business, culture and politics – but that it took so long to get off the ground. Even when computers were mainly run on punch-cards and paper tape, there were whispers that it was inevitable that they would one day work collectively, in a network, rather than individually. (Tracing the origins of online culture even further back is some people\'s idea of an entertaining game: there are those who will tell you that the Talmud, the book of Jewish law, contains a form of hypertext, the linking-and-clicking structure at the heart of the web.) In 1945, the American presidential science adviser, Vannevar Bush, was already imagining the \"memex\", a device in which \"an individual stores all his books, records, and communications\", which would be linked to each other by \"a mesh of associative trails\", like weblinks. Others had frenzied visions of the world\'s machines turning into a kind of conscious brain. And in 1946, an astonishingly complete vision of the future appeared in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. In a story entitled A Logic Named Joe, the author Murray Leinster envisioned a world in which every home was equipped with a tabletop box that he called a \"logic\":\r\n\r\n\"You got a logic in your house. It looks like a vision receiver used to, only it\'s got keys instead of dials and you punch the keys for what you wanna get . . . you punch \'Sally Hancock\'s Phone\' an\' the screen blinks an\' sputters an\' you\'re hooked up with the logic in her house an\' if somebody answers you got a vision-phone connection. But besides that, if you punch for the weather forecast [or] who was mistress of the White House durin\' Garfield\'s administration . . . that comes on the screen too. The relays in the tank do it. The tank is a big buildin\' full of all the facts in creation . . . hooked in with all the other tanks all over the country . . . The only thing it won\'t do is tell you exactly what your wife meant when she said, \'Oh, you think so, do you?\' in that peculiar kinda voice \"\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nDespite all these predictions, though, the arrival of the internet in the shape we know it today was never a matter of inevitability. It was a crucial idiosyncracy of the Arpanet that its funding came from the American defence establishment – but that the millions ended up on university campuses, with researchers who embraced an anti-establishment ethic, and who in many cases were committedly leftwing; one computer scientist took great pleasure in wearing an anti-Vietnam badge to a briefing at the Pentagon. Instead of smothering their research in the utmost secrecy – as you might expect of a cold war project aimed at winning a technological battle against Moscow – they made public every step of their thinking, in documents known as Requests For Comments.\r\n\r\nDeliberately or not, they helped encourage a vibrant culture of hobbyists on the fringes of academia – students and rank amateurs who built their own electronic bulletin-board systems and eventually FidoNet, a network to connect them to each other. An argument can be made that these unofficial tinkerings did as much to create the public internet as did the Arpanet. Well into the 90s, by the time the Arpanet had been replaced by NSFNet, a larger government-funded network, it was still the official position that only academic researchers, and those affiliated to them, were supposed to use the network. It was the hobbyists, making unofficial connections into the main system, who first opened the internet up to allcomers.\r\n\r\nWhat made all of this possible, on a technical level, was simultaneously the dullest-sounding and most crucial development since Kleinrock\'s first message. This was the software known as TCP/IP, which made it possible for networks to connect to other networks, creating a \"network of networks\", capable of expanding virtually infinitely – which is another way of defining what the internet is. It\'s for this reason that the inventors of TCP/IP, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, are contenders for the title of fathers of the internet, although Kleinrock, understandably, disagrees. \"Let me use an analogy,\" he says. \"You would certainly not credit the birth of aviation to the invention of the jet engine. The Wright Brothers launched aviation. Jet engines greatly improved things.\"\r\n\r\nThe spread of the internet across the Atlantic, through academia and eventually to the public, is a tale too intricate to recount here, though it bears mentioning that British Telecom and the British government didn\'t really want the internet at all: along with other European governments, they were in favour of a different networking technology, Open Systems Interconnect. Nevertheless, by July 1992, an Essex-born businessman named Cliff Stanford had opened Demon Internet, Britain\'s first commercial internet service provider. Officially, the public still wasn\'t meant to be connecting to the internet. \"But it was never a real problem,\" Stanford says today. \"The people trying to enforce that weren\'t working very hard to make it happen, and the people working to do the opposite were working much harder.\" The French consulate in London was an early customer, paying Demon £10 a month instead of thousands of pounds to lease a private line to Paris from BT.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nAfter a year or so, Demon had between 2,000 and 3,000 users, but they weren\'t always clear why they had signed up: it was as if they had sensed the direction of the future, in some inchoate fashion, but hadn\'t thought things through any further than that. \"The question we always got was: \'OK, I\'m connected – what do I do now?\'\" Stanford recalls. \"It was one of the most common questions on our support line. We would answer with \'Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to send an email?\' \'Well, I don\'t know anyone with an email address.\' People got connected, but they didn\'t know what was meant to happen next.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, a couple of years previously, a British scientist based at Cern, the physics laboratory outside Geneva, had begun to answer that question, and by 1993 his answer was beginning to be known to the general public. What happened next was the web.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the web\r\n\r\nI sent my first email in 1994, not long after arriving at university, from a small, under-ventilated computer room that smelt strongly of sweat. Email had been in existence for decades by then – the @ symbol was introduced in 1971, and the first message, according to the programmer who sent it, Ray Tomlinson, was \"something like QWERTYUIOP\". (The test messages, Tomlinson has said, \"were entirely forgettable, and I have, therefore, forgotten them\".) But according to an unscientific poll of friends, family and colleagues, 1994 seems fairly typical: I was neither an early adopter nor a late one. A couple of years later I got my first mobile phone, which came with two batteries: a very large one, for normal use, and an extremely large one, for those occasions on which you might actually want a few hours of power. By the time I arrived at the Guardian, email was in use, but only as an add-on to the internal messaging system, operated via chunky beige terminals with green-on-black screens. It took for ever to find the @ symbol on the keyboard, and I don\'t remember anything like an inbox, a sent-mail folder, or attachments. I am 34 years old, but sometimes I feel like Methuselah.\r\n\r\nI have no recollection of when I first used the world wide web, though it was almost certainly when people still called it the world wide web, or even W3, perhaps in the same breath as the phrase \"information superhighway\", made popular by Al Gore. (Or \"infobahn\": did any of us really, ever, call the internet the \"infobahn\"?) For most of us, though, the web is in effect synonymous with the internet, even if we grasp that in technical terms that\'s inaccurate: the web is simply a system that sits on top of the internet, making it greatly easier to navigate the information there, and to use it as a medium of sharing and communication. But the distinction rarely seems relevant in everyday life now, which is why its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, has his own legitimate claim to be the progenitor of the internet as we know it. The first ever website was his own, at CERN: info.cern.ch.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nThe idea that a network of computers might enable a specific new way of thinking about information, instead of just allowing people to access the data on each other\'s terminals, had been around for as long as the idea of the network itself: it\'s there in Vannevar Bush\'s memex, and Murray Leinster\'s logics. But the grandest expression of it was Project Xanadu, launched in 1960 by the American philosopher Ted Nelson, who imagined – and started to build – a vast repository for every piece of writing in existence, with everything connected to everything else according to a principle he called \"transclusion\". It was also, presciently, intended as a method for handling many of the problems that would come to plague the media in the age of the internet, automatically channelling small royalties back to the authors of anything that was linked. Xanadu was a mind-spinning vision – and at least according to an unflattering portrayal by Wired magazine in 1995, over which Nelson threatened to sue, led those attempting to create it into a rabbit-hole of confusion, backbiting and \"heart-slashing despair\". Nelson continues to develop Xanadu today, arguing that it is a vastly superior alternative to the web. \"WE FIGHT ON,\" the Xanadu website declares, sounding rather beleaguered, not least since the declaration is made on a website.\r\n\r\nWeb browsers crossed the border into mainstream use far more rapidly than had been the case with the internet itself: Mosaic launched in 1993 and Netscape followed soon after, though it was an embarrassingly long time before Microsoft realised the commercial necessity of getting involved at all. Amazon and eBay were online by 1995. And in 1998 came Google, offering a powerful new way to search the proliferating mass of information on the web. Until not too long before Google, it had been common for search or directory websites to boast about how much of the web\'s information they had indexed – the relic of a brief period, hilarious in hindsight, when a user might genuinely have hoped to check all the webpages that mentioned a given subject. Google, and others, saw that the key to the web\'s future would be helping users exclude almost everything on any given topic, restricting search results to the most relevant pages.\r\n\r\nWithout most of us quite noticing when it happened, the web went from being a strange new curiosity to a background condition of everyday life: I have no memory of there being an intermediate stage, when, say, half the information I needed on a particular topic could be found online, while the other half still required visits to libraries. \"I remember the first time I saw a web address on the side of a truck, and I thought, huh, OK, something\'s happening here,\" says Spike Ilacqua, who years beforehand had helped found The World, the first commercial internet service provider in the US. Finally, he stopped telling acquaintances that he worked in \"computers\", and started to say that he worked on \"the internet\", and nobody thought that was strange.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nIt is absurd – though also unavoidable here – to compact the whole of what happened from then onwards into a few sentences: the dotcom boom, the historically unprecedented dotcom bust, the growing \"digital divide\", and then the hugely significant flourishing, over the last seven years, of what became known as Web 2.0. It is only this latter period that has revealed the true capacity of the web for \"generativity\", for the publishing of blogs by anyone who could type, for podcasting and video-sharing, for the undermining of totalitarian regimes, for the use of sites such as Twitter and Facebook to create (and ruin) friendships, spread fashions and rumours, or organise political resistance. But you almost certainly know all this: it\'s part of what these days, in many parts of the world, we call \"just being alive\".\r\n\r\nThe most confounding thing of all is that in a few years\' time, all this stupendous change will probably seem like not very much change at all. As Crocker points out, when you\'re dealing with exponential growth, the distance from A to B looks huge until you get to point C, whereupon the distance between A and B looks like almost nothing; when you get to point D, the distance between B and C looks similarly tiny. One day, presumably, everything that has happened in the last 40 years will look like early throat-clearings — mere preparations for whatever the internet is destined to become. We will be the equivalents of the late-60s computer engineers, in their horn-rimmed glasses, brown suits, and brown ties, strange, period-costume characters populating some dimly remembered past.\r\n\r\nWill you remember when the web was something you accessed primarily via a computer? Will you remember when there were places you couldn\'t get a wireless connection? Will you remember when \"being on the web\" was still a distinct concept, something that described only a part of your life, instead of permeating all of it? Will you remember Google?', 28, 6);

The airplane descended over Chicago, its galaxy of electric lights, the vast neighborhoods coming clearer as the plane glided toward the airport—streetlights, headlights, stacks of buildings, ice rinks, a truck turning at a stoplight, scraps of snow atop a warehouse and winking antennae on faraway hills, finally the long converging parallels of blue runway lights, and they were down.\r\n\r\nHe walked into the airport, past the banks of monitors. Already he felt as if he\'d lost something, some beautiful perspective, some lovely dream fallen away. He had come to Chicago to see his wife, whom he had not seen in twenty years. She was there to perform her magic for a higher-up at the state university. Even universities, apparently, were interested in what she could do. Outside the terminal the sky was thick and gray and hurried by wind. Snow was coming. A woman from the university met him and escorted him to her Jeep. He kept his gaze out the window.\r\n\r\nThey were in the car for forty-five minutes, passing first the tall, lighted architecture of downtown, then naked suburban oaks, heaps of ploughed snow, gas stations, power towers, and telephone wires. The woman said, \"So you regularly attend your wife\'s performances?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"Never before.\"\r\n\r\nShe parked in the driveway of an elaborate modern mansion, with square balconies suspended over two garages, huge triangular windows in the façade, sleek columns, domed lights, a steep shale roof.\r\n\r\nInside the front door about thirty nametags were laid out on a table. His wife was not there yet. No one, apparently, was there yet. He found his tag and pinned it to his sweater. A silent girl in a tuxedo appeared and disappeared with his coat.\r\n\r\nThe granite foyer was backed with a grand staircase, which spread wide at the bottom and tapered at the top. A woman came down. She stopped four or five steps from the bottom and said, \"Hello, Anne\" to the woman who had driven him there and \"You must be Mr. Dumas\" to him. He took her hand, a pale, bony thing, weightless, like a featherless bird.\r\n\r\nHer husband, the university\'s chancellor, was just knotting his bow tie, she said, and she laughed sadly to herself, as if bow ties were something she disapproved of. The hunter moved to a window, shifted aside the curtain, and peered out.\r\n\r\nIn the poor light he could see a wooden deck the length of the house, angled and stepped, its width ever changing, with a low rail. Beyond it, in the blue shadows, a small pond lay encircled by hedges, with a marble birdbath at its center. Behind the pond stood leafless trees—oaks, maples, a sycamore as white as bone. A helicopter shuttled past, its green light winking.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s snowing,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" the hostess asked, with an air of concern, perhaps false. It was impossible to tell what was sincere and what was not. The woman who had driven him there had moved to the bar, where she cradled a drink and stared into the carpet.\r\n\r\nHe let the curtain fall back. The chancellor came down the staircase. Other guests fluttered in. A man in gray corduroy, with \"Bruce Maples\" on his nametag, approached him. \"Mr. Dumas,\" he said, \"your wife isn\'t here yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know her?\" the hunter asked. \"Oh, no,\" Maples said, and shook his head. \"No, I don\'t.\" He spread his legs and swiveled his hips as if stretching before a footrace. \"But I\'ve read about her.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter watched as a tall, remarkably thin man stepped through the front door. Hollows behind his jaw and beneath his eyes made him appear ancient and skeletal—as if he were visiting from some other, leaner world. The chancellor approached the thin man, embraced him, and held him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"That\'s President O\'Brien,\" Maples said. \"A famous man, actually, to people who follow those sorts of things. So terrible, what happened to his family.\" Maples stabbed the ice in his drink with his straw.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the hunter began to think he should not have come.\r\n\r\n\"Have you read your wife\'s books?\" Maples asked.\r\n\r\nThe hunter nodded.\r\n\r\n\"In her poems her husband is a hunter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guide hunters.\" He was looking out the window to where snow was settling on the hedges.\r\n\r\n\"Does that ever bother you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killing animals. For a living, I mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter watched snowflakes disappear as they touched the window. Was that what hunting meant to people? Killing animals? He put his fingers to the glass. \"No,\" he said. \"It doesn\'t bother me.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter met his wife in Great Falls, Montana, in the winter of 1972. That winter arrived all at once—you could watch it come. Twin curtains of white appeared in the north, white all the way to the sky, driving south like the end of all things. Cattle galloped the fencelines, bawling. Trees toppled; a barn roof tumbled over the highway. The river changed directions. The wind flung thrushes screaming into the gorse and impaled them on the thorns in grotesque attitudes.\r\n\r\nShe was a magician\'s assistant, beautiful, fifteen years old, an orphan. It was not a new story: a glittery red dress, long legs, a traveling magic show performing in the meeting hall at the Central Christian Church. The hunter had been walking past with an armful of groceries when the wind stopped him in his tracks and drove him into the alley behind the church. He had never felt such wind; it had him pinned. His face was pressed against a low window, and through it he could see the show. The magician was a small man in a dirty blue cape. Above him a sagging banner read THE GREAT VESPUCCI. But the hunter watched only the girl; she was graceful, young, smiling. Like a wrestler, the wind held him against the window.\r\n\r\nThe magician was buckling the girl into a plywood coffin, which was painted garishly with red and blue bolts of lightning. Her neck and head stuck out at one end, her ankles and feet at the other. She beamed; no one had ever before smiled so broadly at being locked into a coffin. The magician started up an electric saw and brought it noisily down through the center of the box, sawing her in half. Then he wheeled her apart, her legs going one way, her torso another. Her neck fell back, her smile faded, her eyes showed only white. The lights dimmed. A child screamed. Wiggle your toes, the magician ordered, flourishing his magic wand, and she did; her disembodied toes wiggled in glittery high-heeled pumps. The audience squealed with delight.\r\n\r\nThe hunter watched her pink, fine-boned face, her hanging hair, her outstretched throat. Her eyes caught the spotlight. Was she looking at him? Did she see his face pressed against the window, the wind slashing at his neck, the groceries—onions, a sack of flour—tumbled to the ground around his feet?\r\n\r\nShe was beautiful to him in a way that nothing else had ever been beautiful. Snow blew down his collar and drifted around his boots. After some time the magician rejoined the severed box halves, unfastened the buckles, and fluttered his wand, and she was whole again. She climbed out of the box and curtsied in her glittering dress. She smiled as if it were the Resurrection itself.\r\n\r\nThen the storm brought down a pine tree in front of the courthouse, and the power winked out, streetlight by streetlight. Before she could move, before the ushers could begin escorting the crowd out with flashlights, the hunter was slinking into the hall, making for the stage, calling for her.\r\n\r\nHe was thirty years old, twice her age. She smiled at him, leaned over from the dais in the red glow of the emergency exit lights, and shook her head. \"Show\'s over,\" she said. In his pickup he trailed the magician\'s van through the blizzard to her next show, a library fundraiser in Butte. The next night he followed her to Missoula. He rushed to the stage after each performance. \"Just eat dinner with me,\" he\'d plead. \"Just tell me your name.\" It was hunting by persistence. She said yes in Bozeman. Her name was plain, Mary Roberts. They had rhubarb pie in a hotel restaurant.\r\n\r\n\"I know how you do it,\" he said. \"The feet in the box are dummies. You hold your legs against your chest and wiggle the dummy feet with a string.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"Is that what you do? Follow a girl from town to town to tell her her magic isn\'t real?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"I hunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you\'re not hunting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dream about hunting.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again. \"It\'s not funny,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You\'re right,\" she said, and smiled. \"It\'s not funny. I\'m that way with magic. I dream about it. Even when I\'m not asleep.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked into his plate, thrilled. He searched for something he might say. They ate.\r\n\r\n\"But I dream bigger dreams, you know,\" she said afterward, after she had eaten two pieces of pie, carefully, with a spoon. Her voice was quiet and serious. \"I have magic inside of me. I\'m not going to get sawed in half by Tony Vespucci all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don\'t doubt it,\" the hunter said.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you\'d believe me,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBut the next winter Vespucci brought her back to Great Falls and sawed her in half in the same plywood coffin. And the winter after that. Both times, after the performance, the hunter took her to the Bitterroot Diner, where he watched her eat two pieces of pie. The watching was his favorite part: a hitch in her throat as she swallowed, the way the spoon slid cleanly out from her lips, the way her hair fell over her ear.\r\n\r\nThen she was eighteen, and after pie she let him drive her to his cabin, forty miles from Great Falls, up the Missouri and then east into the Smith River valley. She brought only a small vinyl purse. The truck skidded and sheered as he steered it over the unploughed roads, fishtailing in the deep snow, but she didn\'t seem afraid or worried about where he might be taking her, about the possibility that the truck might sink in a drift, that she might freeze to death in her pea coat and glittery magician\'s-assistant dress. Her breath plumed out in front of her. It was twenty degrees below zero. Soon the roads would be snowed over, impassable until spring.\r\n\r\nAt his one-room cabin, with furs and old rifles on the walls, he unbolted the door to the crawl space and showed her his winter hoard: a hundred smoked trout, plucked pheasants and venison quarters hanging frozen from hooks. \"Enough for two of me,\" he said. She scanned his books over the fireplace—a monograph on grouse habits, a series of journals on upland game birds, a thick tome titled simply Bear. \"Are you tired?\" he asked. \"Would you like to see something?\" He gave her a snowsuit, strapped her boots into a pair of leather snowshoes, and took her to hear the grizzly. She wasn\'t bad on snowshoes, a little clumsy. They went creaking over wind-scalloped snow in the nearly unbearable cold.\r\n\r\nThe bear denned every winter in the same hollow cedar, the top of which had been shorn off by a storm. Black, three-fingered, and huge, in the starlight it resembled a skeletal hand thrust up from the ground, a ghoulish visitor scrabbling its way out of the underworld. They knelt. Above them the stars were knife points, hard and white. \"Put your ear here,\" he whispered. The breath that carried his words crystallized and blew away. They listened, face-to-face, their ears over woodpecker holes in the trunk. She heard it after a minute, tuning her ears in to something like a drowsy sigh, a long exhalation of slumber. Her eyes widened. A full minute passed. She heard it again.\r\n\r\n\"We can see him,\" he whispered, \"but we have to be dead quiet. Grizzlies are light hibernators. Sometimes all you do is step on twigs outside their dens and they\'re up.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to dig at the snow. She stood back, her mouth open, eyes wide. Bent at the waist, the hunter bailed the snow back through his legs. He dug down three feet and then encountered a smooth, icy crust covering a large hole in the base of the tree. Gently he dislodged plates of ice and lifted them aside. From the hole the smell of bear came to her, like wet dog, like wild mushrooms. The hunter removed some leaves. Beneath was a shaggy flank, a patch of brown fur.\r\n\r\n\"He\'s on his back,\" the hunter whispered. \"This is his belly. His forelegs must be up here somewhere.\" He pointed to a place higher on the trunk.\r\n\r\nShe put one hand on his shoulder and knelt in the snow beside the den. Her eyes were wide and unblinking. Her jaw hung open. Above her shoulder a star separated itself from a galaxy and melted through the sky. \"I want to touch him,\" she said. Her voice sounded loud and out of place in that wood, under the naked cedars.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" he whispered. He shook his head no.\r\n\r\n\"Just for a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he hissed. \"You\'re crazy.\" He tugged at her arm. She removed the mitten from her other hand with her teeth and reached down. He pulled at her again but lost his footing and fell back, clutching an empty mitten. As he watched, horrified, she turned and placed both hands, spread-fingered, in the thick shag of the bear\'s chest. Then she lowered her face, as if drinking from the snowy hollow, and pressed her lips to the bear\'s chest. Her entire head was inside the tree. She felt the soft silver tips of fur brush her cheeks. Against her nose one huge rib flexed slightly. She heard the lungs fill and then empty. She heard blood slug through veins.\r\n\r\n\"Want to know what he dreams?\" she asked. Her voice echoed up through the tree and poured from the shorn ends of its hollowed branches. The hunter took his knife from his coat. \"Summer,\" her voice echoed. \"Blackberries. Trout. Dredging his flanks across river pebbles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\'d have liked,\" she said later, back in the cabin as he built up the fire, \"to crawl all the way down there with him. Get into his arms. I\'d grab him by the ears and kiss him on the eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter watched the fire, the flames cutting and sawing, each log a burning bridge. Three years he had waited for this. Three years he had dreamed this girl by his fire. But somehow it had ended up different from what he had imagined. He had thought it would be like a hunt—like waiting hours beside a wallow with his rifle barrel on his pack to see the huge antlered head of a bull elk loom up against the sky, to hear the whole herd behind him inhale and then scatter down the hill. If you had your opening you shot and walked the animal down and that was it. But this felt different. It was exactly as if he were still three years younger, stopped outside the Central Christian Church and driven against a low window by the wind or some other, greater force.\r\n\r\n\"Stay with me,\" he whispered to her, to the fire. \"Stay the winter.\"\r\n\r\nBruce Maples stood beside him, jabbing the ice in his drink with his straw. \"I\'m in athletics,\" he offered. \"I run the athletic department here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mentioned that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I? I don\'t remember. I used to coach track. Hurdles.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter was watching the thin, stricken man, President O\'Brien, as he stood in the corner of the reception room. Every few minutes a couple of guests made their way to him and took O\'Brien\'s hands in their own.\r\n\r\n\"You probably know,\" the hunter told Maples, \"that wolves are hurdlers. Sometimes the people who track them will come to a snag and the prints will disappear. As if the entire pack just leaped into a tree and vanished. Eventually they\'ll find the tracks again, thirty or forty feet away. People used to think it was magic—flying wolves. But all they did was jump. One great coordinated leap.\"\r\n\r\nMaples was looking around the room. \"Huh,\" he said. \"I wouldn\'t know about that.\"\r\n\r\nShe stayed. The first time they made love, she shouted so loudly that coyotes climbed onto the roof and howled down the chimney. He rolled off her, sweating. The coyotes coughed and chuckled all night, like children chattering in the yard, and he had nightmares. \"Last night you had three dreams, and you dreamed you were a wolf each time,\" she whispered. \"You were mad with hunger and running under the moon.\"\r\n\r\nHad he dreamed that? He couldn\'t remember. Maybe he talked in his sleep.\r\n\r\nIn December it never got warmer than fifteen below. The river froze—something he\'d never seen. On Christmas Eve he drove all the way to Helena to buy her figure skates. In the morning they wrapped themselves head-to-toe in furs and went out to skate the river. She held him by the hips and they glided through the blue dawn, skating up the frozen coils and shoals, beneath the leafless alders and cottonwoods, only the bare tips of creek willows showing above the snow. Ahead of them vast white stretches of river faded into darkness.\r\n\r\nIn a wind-polished bend they came upon a dead heron, frozen by its ankles into the ice. It had tried to hack itself out, hammering with its beak first at the ice entombing its feet and then at its own thin and scaly legs. When it finally died, it died upright, wings folded back, beak parted in some final, desperate cry, legs like twin reeds rooted in the ice.\r\n\r\nShe fell to her knees beside the bird. In its eye she saw her face flatly reflected. \"It\'s dead,\" the hunter said. \"Come on. You\'ll freeze too.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. She slipped off her mitten and closed the heron\'s beak in her fist. Almost immediately her eyes rolled back in her head. \"Oh, wow,\" she moaned. \"I can feel her.\" She stayed like that for whole minutes, the hunter standing over her, feeling the cold come up his legs, afraid to touch her as she knelt before the bird. Her hand turned white and then blue in the wind. Finally she stood. \"We have to bury it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThat night she lay stiff and would not sleep. \"It was just a bird,\" he said, unsure of what was bothering her but bothered by it himself. \"We can\'t do anything for a dead bird. It was good that we buried it, but tomorrow something will find it and dig it out.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to him. Her eyes were wide. He remembered how they had looked when she put her hands on the bear. \"When I touched her,\" she said, \"I saw where she went.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nI saw where she went when she died. She was on the shore of a lake with other herons, a hundred others, all facing the same direction, and they were wading among stones. It was dawn, and they watched the sun come up over the trees on the other side of the lake. I saw it as clearly as if I were there.\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled onto his back and watched shadows shift across the ceiling. \"Winter is getting to you,\" he said. He resolved to make sure she went out every day. It was something he\'d long believed: go out every day in winter, or your mind will slip. Every winter the paper was full of stories about ranchers\' wives, snowed in and crazed with cabin fever, who had dispatched their husbands with cleavers or awls.\r\n\r\nWinter threw itself at the cabin. He took her out every day. He showed her a thousand ladybugs hibernating in an orange ball hung in a riverbank hollow; a pair of dormant frogs buried in frozen mud, their blood crystallized until spring. He pried a globe of honeybees from its hive, slow-buzzing, stunned from the sudden exposure, tightly packed around the queen, each bee shimmying for warmth. When he placed the globe in her hands, she fainted, her eyes rolled back. Lying there, she saw all their dreams at once, the winter reveries of scores of worker bees, each one fiercely vivid: bright trails through thorns to a clutch of wild roses, honey tidily brimming a hundred combs.\r\n\r\nWith each day she learned more about what she could do. She felt a foreign and keen sensitivity bubbling in her blood, as if a seed planted long ago were just now sprouting. The larger the animal, the more powerfully it could shake her. The recently dead were virtual mines of visions, casting them off with a slow-fading strength as if cutting a long series of tethers one by one. She pulled off her mittens and touched everything she could: bats, salamanders, a cardinal chick tumbled from its nest, still warm. Ten hibernating garter snakes coiled beneath a rock, eyelids sealed, tongues stilled. Each time she touched a frozen insect, a slumbering amphibian, anything just dead, her eyes rolled back and its visions, its heaven, went shivering through her body.\r\n\r\nTheir first winter passed like that. When he looked out the cabin window, he saw wolf tracks crossing the river, owls hunting from the trees, six feet of snow like a quilt ready to be thrown off. She saw burrowed dreamers nestled under roots against the long twilight, their dreams rippling into the sky like auroras.\r\n\r\nWith love still lodged in his heart like a splinter, he married her in the first muds of spring.\r\n\r\nBruce Maples gasped when the hunter\'s wife finally arrived. She moved through the door like a show horse, demure in the way she kept her eyes down, but assured in her step; she brought each tapered heel down and struck it against the granite. The hunter had not seen his wife for twenty years, and she had changed—become refined, less wild, and somehow, to the hunter, worse for it. Her face had wrinkled around the eyes, and she moved as if avoiding contact with anything near her, as if the hall table or the closet door might suddenly lunge forward to snatch at her lapels. She wore no jewelry, no wedding ring, only a plain black suit, double-breasted.\r\n\r\nShe found her nametag on the table and pinned it to her lapel. Everyone in the reception room looked at her and then looked away. The hunter realized that she, not President O\'Brien, was the guest of honor. In a sense they were courting her. This was their way, the chancellor\'s way—a silent bartender, tuxedoed coat girls, big icy drinks. Give her pie, the hunter thought. Rhubarb pie. Show her a sleeping grizzly.\r\n\r\nThey sat for dinner at a narrow and very long table, fifteen or so high-backed chairs down each side and one at each end. The hunter was seated several places away from his wife. She looked over at him finally, a look of recognition, of warmth, and then looked away again. He must have seemed old to her—he must always have seemed old to her. She did not look at him again.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen staff, in starched whites, brought onion soup, scampi, poached salmon. Around the hunter guests spoke in half whispers about people he did not know. He kept his eyes on the windows and the blowing snow beyond.\r\n\r\nThe river thawed and drove huge saucers of ice toward the Missouri. The hunter felt that old stirring, that quickening in his soul, and would rise in the wide pink dawns, grab his fly rod, and hurry down to the river. Already trout were rising through the chill brown water to take the first insects of spring. Soon the telephone in the cabin was ringing with calls from clients, and his guiding season was on.\r\n\r\nIn April an occasional client wanted a mountain lion or a trip with dogs for birds, but late spring and summer were for trout. He was out every morning before dawn, driving with a thermos of coffee to pick up a lawyer, a widower, a politician with a penchant for wild cutthroat. He came home stinking of fish guts and woke her with eager stories—native trout leaping fifteen-foot cataracts, a stubborn rainbow wedged under a snag.\r\n\r\nBy June she was bored and lonely. She wandered through the forest, but never very far. The summer woods were dense and busy, not like the quiet graveyard feel of winter. Nothing slept for very long; everything was emerging from cocoons, winging about, buzzing, multiplying, having litters, gaining weight. Bear cubs splashed in the river. Chicks screamed for worms. She longed for the stillness of winter, the long slumber, the bare sky, the bone-on-bone sound of bull elk knocking their antlers against trees.\r\n\r\nIn September the big-game hunters came. Each client wanted something different: elk, antelope, a bull moose, a doe. They wanted to see grizzlies, track a wolverine, shoot sandhill cranes. They wanted the heads of seven-by-seven royal bulls for their dens. Every few days he came home smelling of blood, with stories of stupid clients, of the Texan who sat, wheezing, too out of shape to get to the top of a hill for his shot. A bloodthirsty New Yorker claimed he wanted only to photograph black bears; then he pulled a pistol from his boot and fired wildly at two cubs and their mother. Nightly she scrubbed blood out of the hunter\'s coveralls, watched it fade from rust to red to rose in a basin filled with river water.\r\n\r\nShe began to sleep, taking long afternoon naps, three hours or more. Sleep, she learned, was a skill like any other, like getting sawed in half and reassembled, or like divining visions from a dead robin. She taught herself to sleep despite heat, despite noise. Insects flung themselves at the screens, hornets sped down the chimney, the sun angled hot and urgent through the southern windows; still she slept. When he came home each autumn night, exhausted, forearms stained with blood, she was hours into sleep. Outside, the wind was already stripping leaves from the cottonwoods—too soon, he thought. He\'d take her sleeping hand. Both of them lived in the grip of forces they had no control over—the October wind, the revolutions of the earth.\r\n\r\nThat winter was the worst he could remember: from Thanksgiving on they were snowed in, the truck buried under six-foot drifts. The phone line went down in December and stayed down until April. January began with a chinook followed by a terrible freeze. The next morning a three-inch crust of ice covered the snow. On the ranches to the south cattle crashed through and bled to death kicking their way out. Deer punched through with their tiny hooves and suffocated in the deep snow beneath. Trails of blood veined the hills.\r\n\r\nIn the mornings he would find coyote tracks written in the snow around the door to the crawl space, two inches of hardwood between them and all his winter hoard hanging frozen beneath the floorboards. He reinforced the door with baking sheets, nailing them up against the wood and over the hinges. Twice he woke to the sound of claws scrabbling against the metal and charged outside to shout the coyotes away.\r\n\r\nEverywhere he looked something was dying: an elk keeling over, an emaciated doe clattering onto ice like a drunken skeleton. The radio reported huge cattle losses on the southern ranches. Each night he dreamt of wolves, of running with them, soaring over fences and tearing into the steaming carcasses of cattle.\r\n\r\nIn February he woke to coyotes under the cabin. He grabbed his bow and knife and dashed out into the snow barefoot, his feet going numb. They had gone in under the door, chewing and digging the frozen earth under the foundation. He unbolted what was left of the door and swung it free.\r\n\r\nElk arrows were all he had, aluminum shafts tipped with broadheads. He squatted in the dark entrance—their only exit—with his bow at full draw and an arrow nocked. Above him he could hear his wife\'s feet pad quietly over the floorboards. A coyote made a coughing sound. Others shifted and panted. Maybe there were ten. He began to fire arrows steadily into the dark. He heard some bite into the foundation blocks at the back of the crawl space, others sink into flesh. He spent his whole quiver: a dozen arrows. The yelps of speared coyotes went up. A few charged him, and he lashed at them with his knife. He felt teeth go to the bone of his arm, felt hot breath on his cheeks. He lashed with his knife at ribs, tails, skulls. His muscles screamed. The coyotes were in a frenzy. Blood bloomed from his wrist, his thigh.\r\n\r\nShe heard the otherworldly screams of wounded coyotes come up through the floorboards, his grunts and curses as he fought. It sounded as if an exit had been tunneled all the way from hell to open under their house, and what was now pouring out was the worst violence that place could send up. She knelt in front of the fireplace and felt the souls of coyotes as they came through the boards on their way skyward.\r\n\r\nHe was blood-soaked and hungry, and his thigh had been badly bitten, but he worked all day digging out the truck. If he did not get food, they would starve, and he tried to hold the thought of the truck in his mind. He lugged slate and tree bark to wedge under the tires, excavated a mountain of snow from the truck bed. Finally, after dark, he got the engine turned over and ramped the truck up onto the frozen, wind-crusted snow. For a brief, wonderful moment he had it careening over the icy crust, starlight washing through the windows, tires spinning, pistons churning, what looked to be the road unspooling in the headlights. Then he crashed through. Slowly, painfully, he began digging it out again.\r\n\r\nIt was hopeless. He would get it up, and then it would break through a few miles later. Hardly anywhere was the sheet of ice atop the snow thick enough to support the truck\'s weight. For twenty hours he dug and then revved and slid the truck over eight-foot drifts. Three more times it crashed through and sank to the windows. Finally he left it. He was ten miles from home, thirty miles from town.\r\n\r\nHe made a weak and smoky fire with cut boughs and lay beside it and tried to sleep, but he couldn\'t. The heat from the fire melted snow, and trickles ran slowly toward him but froze solid before they reached him. The stars twisting in their constellations above had never seemed farther or colder. In a state that was neither fully sleep nor fully waking, he watched wolves lope around his fire, just outside the reaches of light, slavering and lean. He thought for the first time that he might die if he did not get warmer. He managed to kneel and turn and crawl for home. Around him he could feel the wolves, smell blood on them, hear their nailed feet scrape across the ice.\r\n\r\nHe traveled all that night and all the next day, near catatonia, sometimes on his feet, more often on his elbows and knees. At times he thought he was a wolf, and at times he thought he was dead. When he finally made it to the cabin, there were no tracks on the porch, no sign that she had gone out. The crawl-space door was still flung open, and shreds of the siding and the doorframe lay scattered about.\r\n\r\nShe was kneeling on the floor, ice in her hair, lost in some kind of hypothermic torpor. With his last dregs of energy he constructed a fire and poured a mug of hot water down her throat. As he fell into sleep, he watched himself as from a distance, weeping and clutching his near-frozen wife.\r\n\r\nThey had only flour and a few crackers in the cupboards. When she could speak, her voice was quiet and far away. \"I have dreamt the most amazing things,\" she murmured. \"I have seen the places where coyotes go when they are gone. I know where spiders go, and geese ... \"\r\n\r\nSnow fell incessantly. Night was abiding; daylight passed in a breath. The hunter was beyond hungry. Whenever he stood up, his eyesight fled in slow, nauseating streaks of color. He went out with lanterns to fish, shoveled down to the river ice, chopped through it with a maul, and shivered over the hole jigging a ball of dough on a hook. Sometimes he brought back a trout; other times they ate a squirrel, a hare, once a famished deer whose bones he cracked and boiled, or only a few handfuls of rose hips. In the worst parts of March he dug out cattails to peel and steam the tubers.\r\n\r\nShe hardly ate, sleeping eighteen, twenty hours a day. When she woke, it was to scribble on notebook paper before plummeting back into sleep, clutching at the blankets as if they gave her sustenance. There was, she was learning, strength hidden at the center of weakness, ground at the bottom of the deepest pit. With her stomach empty and her body quieted, without the daily demands of living, she felt she was making important discoveries. She was only nineteen and had lost twenty pounds since marrying him. Naked, she was all rib cage and pelvis.\r\n\r\nHe read her scribbled dreams, but they seemed to be senseless poems and gave him no clues to her.\r\n\r\nSnail: sleds down stones in the rain.\r\n\r\nOwl: fixes his eyes on hare, drops as if from the moon.\r\n\r\nHorse: rides across the plains with his brothers ...\r\n\r\nIn April the temperature rose above zero and then above twenty. He strapped an extra battery to his pack and went to dig out the truck. Its excavation took all day. He drove it slowly back up the slushy road in the moonlight and asked if she\'d like to go to town the next morning. To his surprise, she said yes. They heated water for baths and dressed in clothes they hadn\'t worn in six months. She threaded twine through her belt loops to keep her trousers up.\r\n\r\nBehind the wheel his chest filled to have her with him, to be moving out into the country, to see the sun above the trees. Spring was coming; the valley was dressing up. Look there, he wanted to say, those geese streaming over the road. The valley lives. Even after a winter like that.\r\n\r\nShe asked him to drop her off at the library. He bought food—a dozen frozen pizzas, potatoes, eggs, carrots. He nearly wept at seeing bananas. In the parking lot he drank a half gallon of milk. When he picked her up at the library, she had applied for a library card and borrowed twenty books. They stopped at the Bitterroot for hamburgers and rhubarb pie. She ate three pieces. He watched her eat, the spoon sliding out of her mouth. This was better. This was more like his dreams.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mary,\" he said, \"I think we made it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love pie,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the line was repaired, the phone began to ring. He took his fishing clients down the river. She sat on the porch, reading, reading.\r\n\r\nSoon her sudden and ravenous appetite for books could not be met by the Great Falls Public Library. She wanted other books—essays about sorcery, primers on magic-working and conjury that had to be mail-ordered from New Hampshire, New Orleans, even Italy. Once a week the hunter drove to town to collect a parcel of books from the post office: Arcana Mundi, The Seer\'s Dictionary, Paragon of Wizardry, Occult Science Among the Ancients. He opened one to a random page and read \"Bring water, tie a soft fillet around your altar, burn it on fresh twigs and frankincense ...\"\r\n\r\nShe regained her health, took on energy, no longer lay under furs dreaming all day. She was out of bed before he was, brewing coffee, her nose already between pages. With a steady diet of meat and vegetables her body bloomed, her hair shone, her eyes and cheeks glowed. How beautiful she seemed to him in those few hours he was home. After supper he would watch her read in the firelight, blackbird feathers tied all through her hair, a heron\'s beak hanging between her breasts.\r\n\r\nIn November he took a Sunday off and they cross-country skied. They came across a bull elk frozen to death in a draw. Ravens shrieked at them as they skied to it. She knelt and put her palm on the leathered skull. \"There,\" she moaned. \"I feel him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you feel?\" he asked, standing behind her. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nShe stood, trembling. \"I feel his life flowing out,\" she said. \"I see where he goes, what he sees.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that\'s impossible,\" he said. \"It\'s like saying you know what I dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she said. \"You dream about wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that elk\'s been dead at least a day. It doesn\'t go anywhere. It goes into the crops of those ravens.\"\r\n\r\nHow could she tell him? How could she ask him to understand such a thing? How could anyone understand? More clearly than ever she could see that there was a fine line between dreams and wakefulness, between living and dying, a line so tenuous it sometimes didn\'t exist. It was always clearest for her in winter. In winter, in that valley, life and death were not so different. The heart of a hibernating newt was frozen solid, but she could warm and wake it in her palm. For the newt there was no line at all, no fence, no River Styx, only an area between living and dying, like a snowfield between two lakes: a place where dreams and wakefulness met, where death was only a possibility and visions rose shimmering to the stars like smoke. All that was needed was a hand, the heat of a palm, the touch of fingers.\r\n\r\nThat February the sun shone during the days and ice formed at night—slick sheets glazing the wheat fields, the roofs and roads. One day he dropped her off at the library, the chains on the tires rattling as he pulled away, heading back up the Missouri toward Fort Benton.\r\n\r\nAround noon Marlin Spokes, a snowplough driver the hunter knew from grade school, slid off the Sun River Bridge in his plough and dropped forty feet into the river. He was dead before they could get him out of the truck. She was reading in the library, a block away, and heard the plough crash into the riverbed like a thousand dropped girders. When she got to the bridge, sprinting in her jeans and T-shirt, men were already in the water—a telephone man from Helena, a jeweler, a butcher in his apron, all of them had scrambled down the banks and were wading in the rapids, prying the door open. The men lifted Marlin from the cab, stumbling as they carried him. Steam rose from their shoulders and from the crushed hood of the plough. She careened down the snow-covered slope and splashed to them. Her hand on the jeweler\'s arm, her leg against the butcher\'s leg, she reached for Marlin\'s ankle.\r\n\r\nWhen her finger touched Marlin\'s body, her eyes rolled back and a single vision leaped to her: Marlin Spokes pedaling a bicycle, a child\'s seat mounted over the rear tire with a helmeted boy—Marlin\'s own son—strapped into it. Spangles of light drifted over the riders as they rolled down a lane beneath giant, sprawling maples. The boy reached for Marlin\'s hair with one small fist. In the glass of a storefront window their reflection flashed past. Fallen leaves turned over in their wake. This quiet vision—like a ribbon of rich silk—ran out slowly and fluidly, with great power, and she shook beneath it. It was she who pedaled the bike. The boy\'s fingers pulled through her hair.\r\n\r\nThe men who were touching her or touching Marlin saw what she saw, felt what she felt. At first they spoke of it only in their basements, at night, but Great Falls was not a big town, and this was not something one could keep locked in a basement. Soon they discussed it everywhere—in the supermarket, at the gasoline pumps. People who didn\'t know Marlin Spokes or his son or the hunter\'s wife or any of the men in the river that morning soon spoke of the event like experts. \"All you had to do was touch her,\" a barber said, \"and you saw it too.\" \"The most beautiful lane you\'ve ever dreamed,\" a deli owner raved. \"You didn\'t just pedal his son around,\" movie ushers whispered, \"you loved him.\"\r\n\r\nHe could have heard anywhere. In the cabin he built up the fire, flipped idly through a stack of her books. He couldn\'t understand them—one of them wasn\'t even in English.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner she took the plates to the sink.\r\n\r\n\"You read Spanish now?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHer hands in the sink stilled. \"It\'s Portuguese,\" she said. \"I understand only a little.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his fork in his hands. \"Were you there when Marlin Spokes was killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I helped pull him out of the truck. I don\'t think I was much good.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the back of her head. He felt like driving his fork through the table. \"What tricks did you play? Did you hypnotize people?\"\r\n\r\nHer shoulders tightened. Her voice came out furious. \"Why can\'t you—\" she began, but her voice fell off. \"It wasn\'t tricks,\" she muttered. \"I helped carry him.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she started to get phone calls, he hung up on the callers. But they were relentless: a grieving widow, an orphan\'s lawyer, a reporter from the Great Falls Tribune. A blubbering father drove all the way to the cabin to beg her to come to the funeral parlor, and finally she went. The hunter insisted on driving her. It wasn\'t right, he declared, for her to go alone. He waited in the truck in the parking lot, engine rattling, radio moaning.\r\n\r\n\"I feel so alive,\" she said afterward, as he helped her into the cab. Her clothes were soaked through with sweat. \"Like my blood is fizzing through my body.\" At home she lay awake, far away, all night.\r\n\r\nShe got called back and called back, and each time he drove her. He would take her after a whole day of duck hunting and pass out from exhaustion while he waited in the truck. When he woke, she would be beside him, holding his hand, her hair damp, her eyes wild. \"You dreamt you were with the wolves and eating salmon,\" she said. \"They were washed up and dying on the shoals.\"\r\n\r\nHe drove them home over the dark fields. He tried to soften his voice. \"What do you do in there? What really?\"\r\n\r\n\"I give them solace. I let them say good-bye to their loved ones. I help them know something they\'d never otherwise know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"I mean what kind of tricks? How do you do it?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her hands palms up. \"As long as they\'re touching me, they see what I see. Come in with me next time. Go in there and hold hands. Then you\'ll know.\"\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. The stars above the windshield seemed fixed in their places.\r\n\r\nFamilies wanted to pay her; most wouldn\'t let her leave until they did. She would come out to the truck with fifty, a hundred—once four hundred—dollars folded into her pocket. She began to go off for weekends, disappearing in the truck before he was up, a fearless driver. She knelt by roadkill—a crumpled porcupine, a shattered deer. She pressed her palm to the truck\'s grille, where the husks of insects smoked. Seasons came and went. She was gone half the winter. Each of them was alone. They never spoke. On longer drives she was sometimes tempted to keep the truck pointed away and never return.\r\n\r\nIn the first thaws he would go out to the river and try to lose himself in the rhythm of casting, in the sound of pebbles driven downstream, clacking together. But even fishing had become lonely for him. Everything, it seemed, was out of his hands—his truck, his wife, the course of his own life.\r\n\r\nAs hunting season came on, his mind wandered. He was botching kills—getting upwind of elk, or telling a client to unload and call it quits thirty seconds before a pheasant burst from cover. When a client missed his mark and pegged an antelope in the neck, the hunter berated him for being careless, knelt over its tracks, and clutched at the bloody snow. \"Do you understand what you\'ve done?\" he shouted. \"How the arrow shaft will knock against the trees, how the animal will run and run, how the wolves will trot behind it to keep it from resting?\"\r\n\r\nThe client was red-faced, huffing. \"Wolves don\'t hunt here,\" the client said. \"There haven\'t been wolves here for twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nShe was in Butte or Missoula when he discovered her money in a boot: six thousand dollars and change. He canceled his trips and stewed for two days, pacing the porch, sifting through her things, rehearsing his arguments. When she saw him, the sheaf of bills jutting from his shirt pocket, she stopped halfway to the door, her bag over her shoulder, her hair pulled back.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s not right,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe walked past him into the cabin. \"I\'m helping people. I\'m doing what I love. Can\'t you see how good I feel afterward?\"\r\n\r\n\"You take advantage of them. They\'re grieving, and you take their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"They want to pay me,\" she shrieked. \"I help them see something they desperately want to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a grift. A con.\"\r\n\r\nShe came back out on the porch. \"No,\" she said. Her voice was quiet and strong. \"This is real. As real as anything: the valley, the river, your trout hanging in the crawl space. I have a talent. A gift.\"\r\n\r\nHe snorted. \"A gift for hocus-pocus. For swindling widows out of their savings.\" He lobbed the money into the yard. The wind caught the bills and scattered them over the snow.\r\n\r\nShe hit him, once, hard across the mouth. \"How dare you?\" she cried. \"You, of all people, should understand. You who dreams of wolves every night.\"\r\n\r\nIn the months that followed, she left the cabin more frequently and for longer durations, visiting homes, accident sites, and funeral parlors all over central Montana. Finally she pointed the truck south and didn\'t turn back. They had been married five years.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, in the Bitterroot Diner, he looked up at the ceiling-mounted television and there she was, being interviewed. She lived in Manhattan, had traveled the world, had written two books. She was in demand all over the country.\r\n\r\n\"Do you commune with the dead?\" the interviewer asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"I help people. I commune with the living. I give people peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the interviewer said, turning to speak into the camera, \"I believe it.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter bought her books at the bookstore and read them in one night. She had written poems about the valley, written them to the animals: you rampant coyote, you glorious buck. She had traveled to Sudan to touch the backbone of a fossilized stegosaur, and wrote of her frustration when she divined nothing from it. A TV network flew her to Kamchatka to embrace the huge, shaggy neck of a mammoth as it was air-lifted from a glacier. She\'d had better luck with that one, describing an entire herd slogging big-footed through a slushy tide, tearing at sea grass and flaring their ears to catch the sun. In a handful of poems there were even vague allusions to him—a brooding, blood-soaked presence that hovered outside the margins like a storm on its way, like a killer hiding in the basement.\r\n\r\nThe hunter was fifty-eight years old. Twenty years was a long time. The valley had diminished slowly but perceptibly: roads came in, and the grizzlies left, seeking higher country. Loggers had thinned nearly every accessible stand of trees. Every spring runoff from logging roads turned the river chocolate-brown, and the soil from the old forests was being washed into the Missouri. In his cabin, bent over the table, he set aside her books, took a pencil, and wrote her a letter.\r\n\r\nA week later a Federal Express truck drove all the way to the cabin. Inside the envelope was her response, on embossed stationery. The handwriting was hurried and efficient. I will be in Chicago, it said, day after tomorrow. Enclosed is a plane ticket. Feel free to come. Thank you for writing.\r\n\r\nAfter sherbet the chancellor called his guests into the reception room. Burning candles had been distributed around the room: on the sills, the banister, the mantel, the bookshelves. The bar had been taken down; in its place three caskets had been set on the carpet. A bit of snow that had fallen on the lids—they must have been kept outside—was melting, and drops ran onto the carpet, where they left dark circles. Around the caskets cushions had been placed on the floor. The hunter leaned against the entryway and watched guests drift uncomfortably into the room, some cradling coffee cups, others gulping at gin or vodka in deep tumblers. Eventually everyone settled on the floor in a circle.\r\n\r\nThe hunter\'s wife came in then, elegant in her dark suit. She knelt and motioned for O\'Brien to sit beside her. His face was pinched and inscrutable. Again the hunter had the impression that he was not of this world but of a slightly leaner one.\r\n\r\n\"President O\'Brien,\" his wife said, \"I know this is difficult for you. Death can seem so final, like a blade dropped through the neck. But the nature of death is not at all final. It is not some dark cliff off which we leap. I hope to show you it is merely a fog, something we can peer into and out of, something we can know and face and not necessarily fear. By each life taken from our collective lives we are diminished. But even in death we have much to celebrate. It is only a transition, like so many others.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved into the circle and unfastened the lids of the caskets. From where he sat the hunter could not see inside. His wife\'s hands fluttered around her waist like birds. \"Think,\" she said. \"Think hard about something you would like resolved, some matter, gone now, in the grips of the past, which you wish you could take back—perhaps with your daughters, a moment, a lost feeling, a desperate wish.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunter closed his eyes. \"Think now,\" his wife was saying, \"of some wonderful moment, some fine and sunny minute you shared, your wife and daughters, all of you together.\" Her voice was lulling. Behind his eyelids the glow of the candles made an even orange wash. He knew her hands were reaching for whatever—whoever—lay in those caskets. Somewhere inside him he felt her extend across the room.\r\n\r\nHis wife said more about beauty and loss being the same thing, about how they ordered the world, and he felt something happening—a strange warmth, a flitting presence, something dim and unsettling, like a feather brushed across the back of his neck. Hands on both sides of him reached for his hands. Fingers locked around his fingers. He wondered if she was hypnotizing him, but it didn\'t matter. He had nothing to fight off or snap out of. She was inside him now; she had reached across and was poking about.\r\n\r\nHer voice faded, and he felt himself swept up as if rising toward the ceiling. Air washed lightly in and out of his lungs; warmth pulsed in the hands that held his. In his mind he saw a sea emerging from fog. The water was broad and flat and glittered like polished metal. He could feel dune grass moving against his shins, and wind coming over his shoulders. All around him bees shuttled over the dunes. Far out a shorebird was diving for crabs. He knew that a few hundred yards away two girls were building castles in the sand; he could hear their song, soft and lilting. Their mother was with them, reclining under an umbrella, one leg bent, the other straight. She was drinking iced tea, and he could taste it in his mouth, sweet and bitter with a trace of mint. Each cell in his body seemed to breathe. He became the girls, the diving bird, the shuttling bees; he was the mother of the girls and the father; he could feel himself flowing outward, richly dissolving, paddling into the world like the very first cell into the great blue sea ...\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw linen curtains, women in gowns kneeling. Tears were visible on many people\'s cheeks—O\'Brien\'s and the chancellor\'s and Bruce Maples\'s. His wife\'s head was bowed. The hunter gently released the hands that held his, stood, and walked out into the kitchen, past the sudsy sinks, the stacks of dishes. He let himself out a side door and found himself on the wooden deck that ran the length of the house, a couple of inches of snow already settled on it.\r\n\r\nHe felt drawn toward the pond, the birdbath, the hedges. He walked to the pond and stood at its rim. The snow fell steadily, and the undersides of the clouds glowed with reflected light from the city.\r\n\r\nBefore long his wife stepped onto the deck and came down to join him. There were things he had been preparing to say: something about a final belief, an expression of gratitude for providing a reason to leave the valley, if only for a night. He wanted to tell her that although the wolves were gone, may always have been gone, they still came to him in dreams. That they could run there, fierce and unfettered, was surely enough. She would understand. She had understood long before he did.\r\n\r\nBut he was afraid to speak. He could see that speaking would be like dashing some very fragile bond to pieces, like kicking a dandelion gone to seed; the wispy, tenuous sphere of its body would scatter in the wind. So instead they stood together, the snow fluttering down from the clouds to melt into the water, where their reflected images trembled like two people trapped against the glass of a parallel world, and he reached, finally, to take her hand.', 29, 5);

(44, 'Heal', 'I stood on the balcony, staring blankly at the crashing waves. The coffee in my hand had grown cold. I ran my fingers on my face, pushing back my wind whipped hair and brushing away my tears at the same time. My cheeks were dry. The salty breeze had dried up the salty tears. I placed the coffee cup on the floor and turned away slightly to avoid the strong winds. And that was when I saw him.\r\n\r\nHe was silhouetted against the pink sky, tall, alone, dark and frozen. He stood there on that rock, looking straight, staring into the ocean just like I had been staring a few minutes ago.  The sky grew orange, then deep rust. The ball of fire slowly sank into the black waters. He stood there a little longer till darkness set in and slowly, head bowed low, stepped off the rock and walked away from the dark sands. My gaze followed him until he vanished behind a clump of bushes. I shut the balcony door and went back into the empty room.\r\n\r\nI was healing. Or atleast, I was supposed to be healing. It was peaceful now, being away from the sympathy and shared tears. My grief was mine and mine alone. I missed Adi every minute of the day, but atleast I didn’t have people telling me, telling me, what a wonderful person he was and what a shock it was to have lost him like that. Like I didn’t know.  Like I didn’t feel. These few weeks in this small seaside town was exactly what I needed. An escape from everyone who knew me. Who knew us. They were well wishers who wanted to share my sorrow, but their good intentions were slowly driving me towards insanity. I needed to get away.\r\n\r\nI went down for dinner. The couple who owned this homestay were in the living room. They looked up from their moment of togetherness and smiled at me. The lady got up and called out to the maid to serve me my dinner. I was a writer, on a break to write a book. That is what they thought. And that was what justified my odd behavior.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I walked on the sand barefoot as the eastern sky grew light. I picked up shells  and then threw them back on the beach. I dug my toes into the cool sand as I walked, breathing in the fresh morning air. I went up to the rock where I saw him last night. I could not shake away that picture from last evening. That was the first time I had seen him in these two weeks, but I instinctively felt some sort of bonding with him. I sat on the rock, staring into the  sea until it became too warm to stay outside.\r\n\r\nI read ,wrote,  swam and took small walks in the shady gardens for the rest of the day, just as I had been doing for the past two weeks. I had not healed yet, but the isolation and the sea had soothed me.  I forced myself not to think of Adi, his smile, his hug. His love.  Those terrible days in the hospital after his accident. I also shouldn’t have survived , but I did. Why?. I suddenly missed him terribly. And I almost burst into tears again.\r\n\r\nThat evening , I walked out to the balcony with my cup of coffee.  Twilight was my favorite part of the day. And as the sky changed colours and the clouds blushed, my eyes scanned the sands and stopped again on that rock. He was there again, standing straight, alert, staring at the waves. Waiting.\r\n\r\nOne more week passed like this. Every evening I wanted to walk up to the beach and go closer to him, but something stopped me. I didn’t want to intrude into whatever it was that brought him there every evening. So I just stood there on my balcony with a cup of neglected coffee, watching him dissolve into the darkness every evening.\r\n\r\nIt was my last day by the sea. I walked past the packed bags on the floor that evening and went downstairs. I smiled a small smile at the new guests who were sipping tea in the living room and walked outside. It was drizzling. I didn’t bother to pick up an umbrella. I stepped into the wind laden spray of raindrops and my feet took me across the damp sands. Towards him. I stood there, still, silent, behind him. He sensed me, but he did not turn. The waves came and went. He stared and waited. The rain grew fiercer, but both of us did not move.\r\n\r\n‘Scott’, a voice called from behind. I turned. A woman was approaching us, flustered and wet. She saw me standing there, behind him. With a curiously glance at me, she instinctively shared her umbrella over my head. I smiled at her and then looked at him again. He hadn’t turned or moved an inch. Her eyes saw the question in my eyes and she shook her head sadly.\r\n\r\n‘ I work in that house, ma’ she said, pointing to a house on the shore, beyond the bushes.\r\n\r\n‘ It has been a year. They were playing in the beach one evening  when she ran into the sea chasing a ball. She was just five years old, such a pretty child. Maggie. We couldn’t even find her body’.\r\n\r\nTears filled the woman’s eyes.\r\n\r\n‘ Her parents were so angry with him that they just abandoned him here and left to their city. He now lives with the old couple in that house. They are a lonely couple, they treat him like their own son now.  But he hasn’t forgotten. He comes here every evening and waits for his little playmate to return from the ocean. Maybe he thinks she will be back someday or maybe he knows and feels guilty that he couldn’t save her’. She shook her head sadly.\r\n\r\nI looked at him, standing on that rock, soaked in the rain, but still unflinching in his wait. A tear rolled down my cheek. For the first time in months, it was not a tear for Adi.\r\n\r\n‘Scott, va’, the woman said and grabbed his collar, almost dragging him. He turned. Our eyes met. ‘ Forget , Scott.’ I whispered. ‘ Heal. They are not coming back. Your Maggie. Or my Adi.’  I bent down to touch him. He moved closer and looked at me, eyes limpid pools of sadness. And as though he understood what I had said, he let out a short bark and wagged his tail.', 32, 4),

(46, 'The point of poetry', 'Let’s begin with a poem that uses most every tool a poet might employ—line, meter, rhyme, along with a thousand other niceties we’ve come to associate with the sound of poetry in the English language.\r\n\r\n    Th’ expence of Spirit in a waste of  shame\r\n    Is lust in action, and till action, lust\r\n    Is periured, murdrous, blouddy full of blame,\r\n    Sauage, extreame, rude, cruell, not to trust ...\r\n\r\nThe syntax of this opening quatrain of Shakespeare’s 129th sonnet contains two independent clauses, each taking the same simple form (x is y), except that in the second clause the y explodes into a long list of predicate adjectives (periured, murdrous, and so on). Reading these lines even as they were first published in 1609, we don’t pay much attention to the commas separating the nine adjectives (modern editors usually insert a comma between “blouddy” and “full of blame”) because we’re used to the way punctuation guides us through a sentence, taking us from the beginning of the poem to the end. But to notice the commas is to attend to a syntax that, in this case, threatens to overwhelm the organizational power of both the rhyme and metrical schemes with its swift accumulation of grammatical bits.\r\n\r\nNow here’s a poem that gives up almost every tool a poet might employ—not only line, meter, and rhyme, but also punctuation.\r\n\r\n    now I say yes to the bridge the dead cross no thicker than a fingernail no wider than a knife eyes fixed on the Gates of  Paradise yes to the visible hills the actual hills olive trees with grey underleaf commas between each breath brief tremor smell of gunpowder then screams it was screams and screams all the way through\r\n\r\nThis passage from Michael Palmer’s “Idem 4” also contains two independent clauses: “I say yes” and “it was screams.” The syntax is more complex than in Shakespeare’s sonnet, but one might punctuate the poem as the syntax requests: “now I say yes to the bridge the dead cross, no thicker than a fingernail, no wider than a knife, my eyes fixed on the Gates of Paradise.” Something is lost here, just as something would be lost if I typed out Sonnet 129 as unpunctuated prose; Palmer wants us to associate a liminal world between life and death with a grammatical space where no commas exist, and his omission of punctuation dilutes the power of his syntax, just as Shakespeare’s highly agglutinative syntax blurs the integrity of his pentameter lines.\r\n\r\nWe’re used to reading poems that give up rhyme, meter, and line. Great poems have often eschewed punctuation as well, but probably because punctuation feels as basic to a poem as letters of the alphabet, we’ve paid less conscious attention to this fundamental element of written language. I don’t know of many unpunctuated prose poems: it’s easy to imagine giving up line, but once you’ve also sworn off punctuation, what do you have left? What would happen if we gave up the practice of separating words with spaces?\r\n\r\nIt’s instructive to remember that leaving a space between written words is a relatively recent convention. Before reading silently became a common practice, ancient and medieval scribes usually didn’t bother with spacing. Neither were the early texts of Greek, Latin, or Old English poems punctuated; nor were their lines registered visually. If you read the eighth-or ninth-century Old English poem we call “The Seafarer” where it was written down in the Exeter Book, it looks something like Palmer’s prose, even though the poem is organized sonically in lines. (I’ll translate this passage into modern English in a moment.)\r\n\r\n    Mæg ic be me sylfum soðgied wrecan siþas secgan hu ic geswincdagum earfoðhwile oft þrowade bitre breostceare gebiden hæbbe gecunnad in ceole cearselda fela atol yþa gewealc\r\n\r\nBut if you read a modern edition of “The Seafarer,” an editor will have adopted the convention of providing obvious visual cues for the sonic structure of the lines.\r\n\r\n    Mæg ic be me sylfum             soðgied wrecan\r\n    siþas secgan            hu ic geswincdagum\r\n\r\nThese lines aren’t distinguished by a relationship between stressed and unstressed syllables, as we’re accustomed to hearing centuries later in Shakespeare. Instead, following older procedures, every line has four stressed syllables, and the lines are further divided into two half-lines, each of which contains two stresses; a variable pattern of alliteration links the stressed syllables of each of the two half lines: “bitre breostceare gebiden hæbbe.” These lines are lines because of the way they sound, just as the metrical line “Th’ expence of Spirit in a waste of shame” and the free-verse line “so much depends” are lines because of their sound—even if now familiar visual conventions have made us aware of how lines look on the page.\r\n\r\nHere’s my translation of the first sentence of “The Seafarer,” a translation that doesn’t replicate the poem’s pattern of stress and alliteration but that does attempt, in its use of modern spelling and punctuation, to stay true to the shape of the syntax.\r\n\r\n    I can tell a true story about myself,\r\n    speak of  my travels, how in days of toil\r\n    often I have endured long hardship,\r\n    abided bitter heartbreak,\r\n    known on shipboard the embrace of sorrow,\r\n    the terrible tossing of waves.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of “The Seafarer” says I can x about y. The first half of the sentence (I can x) consists of three parallel versions of the same independent clause: I can tell a true story, I can speak of my travels, I can speak of how in days of toil. These three clauses are linked paratactically, in a list, asking for two commas to separate them. The third clause then opens the door to another list of three dependent clauses (about how I have endured long hardship, about how I have abided bitter heartbreak, about how I have known the embrace of sorrow), the parallel listing again asking for two commas. The verb of the final dependent clause (known) has two parallel objects (the embrace of sorrow, the tossing of waves), their separation asking for the sentence’s fifth and final comma. These punctuation marks are not condiments sprinkled over the poem at my pleasure; an editor couldn’t use periods or colons. By adding our now conventional punctuation to my translation of the Old English, I’ve made the organization of the syntax explicit, just as printing the poem in lines makes visually explicit its prosody.\r\n\r\nEnglish punctuation, like English spelling, didn’t become grammatically regularized until the rise of a ubiquitous print culture in the seventeenth century. Even when Shakespeare was writing in the early years of that century, punctuation was deployed erratically; John Donne called “points” but “accessories.” With a handful of small exceptions, no manuscript of a subsequently published Shakespearian or Donnian text exists in its author’s hand, but we do possess versions of their near contemporary Sir Thomas Wyatt’s poems written in several hands, including Wyatt’s own.\r\n\r\n    It may be good like it who list\r\n    but I do dowbt who can me blame\r\n    for oft assured yet have I myst\r\n    and now again I fere the same\r\n\r\nIt’s easy enough to hear that Wyatt’s unpunctuated quatrain is written in four-beat, mostly iambic lines (“But I do dowbt who can me blame”), even when the lines run together two independent clauses. But Wyatt’s rhythmic momentum is due to line working against syntax, not to the lack of punctuation as such. Were the syntax lineated this way, with or without editorially imposed punctuation—\r\n\r\n    It may be good,\r\n    like it who list.\r\n    But I do dowbt:\r\n    who can me blame?\r\n\r\n—the poem’s animating rhythmic life would disappear: the duration of the lines and the duration of the clauses and phrases are in every case identical, and the resulting rhythm is clunkily regular. We need to feel the temporal unfolding of a poem’s language in tension with itself, punctuation guiding us through the syntax in one way and line guiding us through it in another.\r\n\r\nWyatt had few rules to break; a poet writing after him gives up punctuation knowing the rules. Writing in the later nineteenth century, Emily Dickinson deployed punctuation with charismatic idiosyncrasy, and writing several decades before her, the English romantic poet John Clare eschewed conventional spelling and punctuation, at least until his early publishers collaborated in making his texts. These metrically impeccable lines (a dimeter line followed by a trimeter, a pentameter, and another trimeter) largely organize the syntax as punctuation would, marking the inauguration of new phrases or clauses with conjunctions (nor, or), adverbs (where), or prepositions (in, of  ).\r\n\r\n    The trembling grass\r\n    Quakes from the human foot\r\n    Nor bears the weight of man to let him pass\r\n    Where thou alone and mute\r\n\r\n    Sittest at rest\r\n    In safety ’neath the clump\r\n    Of  huge flag forrest that thy haunts invest\r\n    Or some old sallow stump\r\n\r\nYet some of the lines of “To the Snipe” divide the syntax more disruptively, as punctuation cannot, cleaving subject from predicate (“The trembling grass/Quakes”—“Where thou alone and mute//Sittest”). These line endings are not marking the division of clauses and phrases but chopping them into pieces and thereby asking us to hear those pieces in a particular way. One feels the drama of the poem’s syntax heightening at these moments, especially because the enjambments are reinforced by the flipping of initial iambs into trochees: “Quakes from”—“Sittest.”\r\n\r\nThe time separating Wyatt, writing in the sixteenth century, and Clare, writing in the nineteenth, is the time not only of the rise of regular punctuation but the time when punctuation is, at least potentially, politicized as we sometimes know it today. When William Carlos Williams omitted punctuation from a free-verse poem at the beginning of the twentieth century, the omission was charged in the world outside the poem: does the omission remain charged? These unpunctuated lines by the later twentieth-century poet W.S. Merwin (born 1927) organize the syntax as punctuation would.\r\n\r\n    Again this procession of  the speechless\r\n    Bringing me their words\r\n    The future woke me with its silence\r\n    I join the procession\r\n    An open doorway\r\n    Speaks for me\r\n    Again\r\n\r\nBut these unpunctuated lines by Ellen Bryant Voigt (born 1943) generally do the opposite, interrupting rather than marking the integrity of grammatical units.\r\n\r\n    first frail green in the northeast the forest around us no longer\r\n    a postcard of Christmas snow clotting the spruce or worse\r\n    fall’s technicolor beeches sumac sugar maple death\r\n    even the death of vegetation should never be\r\n    so beautiful it is unseemly I prefer the cusps\r\n    they focus the mind\r\n\r\nAnd this poem by Jos Charles (born 1988) gives up conventional spelling and lineation as well as punctuation.\r\n\r\n    tonite i wuld luv to rite the mothe inn the guarden / 2 greev it / & as a mater off forme / did u kno not a monthe goes bye / a tran i kno doesnt dye / just shye off 27 / its such a plesure to be alive / inn this trembled soot / u lent / shock is a struktured responce / a whord lost inn the mouthe off keepers / & u thum at the mothe / a dozen bes / i tethered thees nites / i gathred so manie treees\r\n\r\nWhy have these poets made these choices? What have they gained, and, since every gain is purchased at a price, what have they lost?\r\n\r\nMerwin’s “Daybreak” is the final poem in his 1963 volume The Moving Target, the volume in which he first embraced the unpunctuated lines on which he would continue to spin variations for over half a century: were one to punctuate his lines as the syntax suggests, the punctuation would appear exclusively at the end of the lines. The Moving Target begins with punctuated poems, such as “In the Gorge,” and in retrospect one can imagine why Merwin came to find his punctuation unnecessary: the lines already function as punctuation, parsing the syntax into clearly consumable pieces—subject (“Our jagged hands”), prepositional phrase (“Like the ends of a broken bridge”), predicate (“Grope for each other”). Lineating Shakespeare’s sonnet in this way, lines corresponding to uninterrupted grammatical bits—\r\n\r\n    Th’ expence of Spirit\r\n    in a waste of shame\r\n    is lust in action\r\n    and till action\r\n    lust is periured\r\n    murdrous\r\n    blouddy\r\n    full of blame\r\n\r\n—dissipates the most fundamental energy of the poem: the tension between its syntax and its lines (“till action, lust/Is periured”).\r\n\r\nHere is the way Ellen Bryant Voigt did not lineate her syntax in “Privet Hedge,” from her 2013 volume Headwaters.\r\n\r\n    when my friend said knowledge does nothing for him\r\n    I felt at once superior and chastised\r\n    I’d just deduced the five new birds in my yard\r\n    woodpecker size and stripes and red blaze\r\n    but feeding on the ground\r\n    five yellow-shafted flickers\r\n    can the soul be known by its song\r\n    who hears it\r\n    what keeps it aloft\r\n    what keeps it whole\r\n    what helps it survive\r\n\r\nThis imposed lineation preserves the integrity of Voigt’s parallel clauses (who hears, what keeps, what helps), the repetition producing a consistent rhythm. As a result, the poem sounds like a record of considered thought rather than a volatile act of thinking, which is how “Privet Hedge” really sounds.\r\n\r\nThis is how Voigt actually lineates her syntax: rather than emphasizing the grammatical shape of clauses or phrases, the lines use enjambment to shape our experience of the syntax.\r\n\r\n                                                     when my friend said\r\n    knowledge does nothing for him I felt at once superior\r\n    and chastised I’d just deduced the five new birds in my yard\r\n    woodpecker size and stripes and red blaze but feeding on the ground\r\n    five yellow-shafted flickers can the soul be known by its song who hears it\r\n    what keeps it aloft what keeps it whole what helps it survive habitual\r\n    pride greed wrath sloth lust a list compiled by a parent always\r\n    needing something to forgive you for\r\n\r\nVoigt’s lineation of “Privet Hedge” avoids any consistent alignment of syntax and line, either violating the grammatical integrity of the clauses or running them together, thereby creating variable rhythms within the lines. The poem’s list of questions sounds not earnest but bewildered, uttered by someone who has not thought about the deadly sins—“pride greed wrath sloth lust”—until the second she finds herself uttering them. Didn’t this poem begin by talking about the weather?\r\n\r\nJos Charles begins and ends feeld with a spelling invocative of Middle English, the language Geoffrey Chaucer employed roughly four centuries after “The Seafarer” was written in Old English. But the point of the poem is not archival: Charles deploys that diction within a prose that introduces a slash where the early Merwin would use a line ending—between short clauses and phrases, not in the midst of them: “& as a mater off forme/did u kno not a monthe goes bye/a tran i kno doesnt dye.”\r\n\r\nWhat is “a mater off forme” here? Charles invokes a weirder diction, making us think about words we might otherwise take for granted, but the poem doesn’t try to replicate any of the prosodies of the fourteenth century. Instead, the poem’s slashes separate the nine independent and dependent clauses (“tonite i wuld luv,” “a tran i kno”) from their always brief attendant phrases, and at the same time the slashes blur any grammatical hierarchy: the result is that, with so much else in flux, the slash and its use become a stable point in the poem, however initially unfamiliar. This climactic fifty-seventh section of feeld, other sections of which are lineated, asks us baldly to think about what the words say, rather than taking the meaning also for granted.\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing intrinsically right or wrong with any of these kinds of lineation, just as there’s nothing right or wrong about deploying a particular punctuation or spelling or meter. Context is all. We might choose to use line as a substitution for punctuation, leaving each line syntactically complete.\r\n\r\n    now I say yes to the bridge\r\n\r\nOr we might use line to break the syntax in a grammatically predicable way.\r\n\r\n    now I say yes to the bridge\r\n    the dead cross\r\n    no thicker than a fingernail\r\n    no wider than a knife\r\n\r\nOr we might use line to introduce tension, the lines cutting against the grammar of the syntax.\r\n\r\n    no thicker than a fingernail\r\n    no wider than a knife eyes fixed\r\n    on the Gates of Paradise yes\r\n    to the visible hills the actual hills\r\n    olive trees with grey underleaf\r\n\r\nOr we might decide, as Michael Palmer ultimately did, that we want the poem to exist perpetually in a state where we long for “commas between each breath brief.” Even there, however, our experience of Palmer’s syntax is modulated. Just as we feel the opening stanza of Voigt’s “Privet Hedge” coming to a moment of composure with the syntactically complete line “they focus the mind,” we similarly feel Palmer’s prose poem settling down as it ends into the syntactically simpler sentence “it was screams and screams all the way through,” especially given the longer, more complex run-on syntax that precedes it.\r\n\r\nA run-on sentence can be exciting, you’re reading one now! If the English language is a poet’s medium, as oil paint may be a painter’s, then that medium demands that we attend to the qualities distinguishing it. Yet the challenge, as Charles reminds us, is that the medium is not static: we can afford to try, after understanding what oil paint can do (as it were), what’s not done. Why give up conventional punctuation? Why give up line, meter, or rhyme? Why take it up? Without rhyme, meter must do more work to hold our attention. Without meter, line must do more work. Without punctuation, line must also do more work, but what kind will depend on whether the line endings are made to substitute for punctuation of the syntax or to break it.\r\n\r\nLines since Homer’s have sounded these ways, but their effects have meant different things at different times and in different places. An admirer once complained that the American radical poet Adrienne Rich was not imprisoned; instead, she was ignored. In the USSR Mandelstam was murdered for writing a little poem comparing Stalin’s mustache to a cockroach. Could the inflation of a poet’s power be as problematic as the refusal to countenance it? Would Galileo have been imprisoned if he’d said in verse that the earth revolves around the sun?\r\n\r\nThe notion that poems affect the world outside poems is easily exaggerated, but understandably so; poets spend lots of time on a poem’s formal properties, and apparently little things like punctuation beg to be meaningful in ways that are hard to describe. It’s not accidental that Shelley proclaimed poets “unacknowledged legislators” after the idealism fueling the French Revolution went horribly wrong, and any reader might feel today a wish for poetry to be powerful. But the wish has not necessarily empowered poetry. Our few hundred years of print culture, with all its limitations, may in time be forgotten, along with the writers who perpetuated it. But in art, especially this art made of language, another word for limitation is freedom: we only know that art will change.', 34, 2),
